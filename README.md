# CSS calc() Unexpected Behavior with Percentages

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the CSS `calc()` function when used with percentages and other units in dynamic layouts. The calculated width is often incorrect, especially when the parent container's width is not static or changes during page rendering. 

## Bug Description

The `calc()` function, while powerful, exhibits some nuances. It seems to sometimes produce unexpected results when trying to subtract pixels from percentages, particularly when applied dynamically. For instance, if you have a container with a width that is initially unknown or changes responsively, the calculation based on percentage and pixels within `calc()` might not yield accurate results.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` (or similar) in your browser.
3. Observe the element's width. You'll likely notice that it's not what's mathematically expected based on the `calc()` expression.

## Solution

The solution often involves restructuring the CSS or using alternative techniques. The provided solution demonstrates one possible approach to achieve the desired layout, avoiding the direct use of `calc()` in this specific scenario or employing more robust techniques to ensure accurate width calculations, even in dynamic contexts.
